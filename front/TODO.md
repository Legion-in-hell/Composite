# TODO

## Required

- Restore level loading
- Restore connection with server
  - Restore ambient occlusion map for elements
- Add information in the menu about the server state
  - Number of player waiting and in each level
  - Estimated waiting time => nice to have

- Restore occlusion with the light if some element are in front of the camera

## Nice to have

- make floating animation for player
- Rethink the way the level are built, everything could be imported from Blender or other tool to generate
  level
- Check to optimize / improve the shadow player shader
